Spacegame2D
===========

Spacegame2D is a simulated space battle, with the constraint that each ship is flown by an autopilot that receives only realistic sensor data, and controls only weapon and engine power levels.  If a ship wants to spin, it has to figure out how to power its engines to start spinning, and then reverse them to stop.

This is the 2D prototype of Spacegame.

It was basically an excuse to learn 2D physics, real-time control systems and PyGame.
